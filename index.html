We look forward to captivating our readers with stimulating content sure to leave a lasting impression. With so many advertising options available, I'm sure you have questions as to why you should promote your business in this magazine. Magazine advertisements work better for response, as potential buyers are in a different frame of mind when it comes to the larger corporate style adverts. One of the advantages of full color magazine is that you have an advertising media that lends itself to creativity. Magazine ads for high performance or luxury cars, show a car in an environment that is stimulating to the reader giving them a vision of owning and driving that car. One of the main advantages of print media is its capacity to excite and stimulate when people are in a relaxed frame of mind. While newspapers offer print media, their purpose is somewhat different in that they are providing up to date local news, while magazines offer a targeted audience specific to the market of the businesses they approach in line with the content of the magazine. While internet advertising has the edge on cost per lead terms, print media is more easily carried on a person and shared more instantaneously amongst friends and colleagues. Research studies show that when consumers read magazines they are much less likely to engage with other media or to take part in non-media activities compared to the users of TV, radio or the internet. According to research from JackMyers, when consumers were asked to rate media based on how likely they are to pay attention to the advertising messages, magazines ranked at or near the top of the list. One of the other main advantages of print is its credibility. Consumers trust and believe magazines and magazine advertising more than any other media. Simmons Multi-Media Engagement Study shows magazines score higher on being "trustworthy" compared to Television or the internet If you see it in print, it usually holds a higher position of respect and value. </p><h2>Contact</h2>
